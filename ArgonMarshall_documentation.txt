Design
======
The project is designed so that folders are "databases" and inside the database folders, there are files that are "tables."
Inside each table/file, one can view the contents of the table.


Implementation
==============
The program uses "if" and "elif" statements in the main function to evaluate the input command.
It will evaluate the input string and then call a separate function to perform the request.
The functions have been separated into "helper" functions and "main program functions".
Main program functions are functions that are explicitly called from main, and helper functions are called from the main program functions.
More detailed descriptions of each individual function are listed above the functions, including title, description, and pre and post-conditions.
Rather than having one main script, multiple functions are now called from main.

All commands must end in ";" to execute properly, unless it is interpreted as a comment.
Invalid commands will be ignored so that the program does not terminate early.
The script handles all input no matter lower or uppercase by normalizing all commands to uppercase before executing.
For example, users can input "ALTER TABLE" or "alter table" and the program will handle it.

The program executes well by performing several try/catch statements and by performing checks specific to the function.
For example, a database has to exist before it can be deleted and a table has to exist before one can insert into it.


External libraries
==================
The script imports "OS", "RE", and "contextmanager" for use in the program.
OS helps with modifying files within different selected paths.
RE handles the case insensitivity.
contextmanager is used for reading from multiple files to handle the JOIN queries.


How to execute
==============
Preconditions:
    - Access to a linux terminal
    - Python 2 installed on the machine
    - ArgonMarshall_p3.py and PA3_test.sql are in the same folder

In a linux terminal:
Navigate to the folder containing ArgonMarshall_p3.py and PA3_test.sql
Type "python ArgonMarshall_p3.py < PA3_test.sql" to execute the script
